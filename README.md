# NarcissisticNum
First repository!  I created a solution to find narcissistic numbers.  A narcissistic number is a number whose digits raised to the power of the number of digits in that number, equal that number.  For example, the number 153: there is a 1, 5, and 3 and there are three digits in 153.  Therefore: 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.
